üîê INTELSTRUCT: Complex Intelligence Cyber Orchestrator


---

üß† Core Objective:

Design a cyber-intelligence architecture that:

Detects reverse PowerShell sessions,

Analyzes PE header anomalies,

Uses ML to flag persistent threats,

Dynamically switches between native GUI and Flutter interface (via Switcheroo),

Integrates secure communication (TLS, C2 analysis),

Can self-evolve based on forensic memory dumps and user/system interaction patterns.



---

üèóÔ∏è System Components

1. Cyber Intelligence Kernel (Rust)

Crates: tokio, actix-web, winapi, pelite, serde, hyper, napi-rs

- Reverse shell detector (low-level syscall hooks)
- PE parser and corrupt header inspector
- DOS signature anomaly mapper
- Secure logging + IPC with Python layer
- Plugin support for fuzzing PE headers


---

2. Neural Analysis Engine (Python 4 / FastAPI)

Libs: torch, transformers, scikit-learn, pefile, yara-python, pymem

- Memory dump forensic module (RAM scans for dllhost.exe)
- Transformer model classifying threat levels from header entropy + opcode density
- Live PE behavior emulator (using Unicorn Engine)
- Encrypted artifact recompiler for corrupted binaries


---

3. Switcheroo UX Layer (Flutter + Native)

Auto-switch between Flutter interface (for modern UX) and native Win32 GUI (for stealth/admin use)

Context-aware (admin vs operator)

Logs and visualizes ML threat traces and forensic memory maps



---

4. Secure Command Protocol Layer

TLS-mutual-auth C2 decoding engine

Multi-threaded socket server for concurrent forensic agents

Isolated plugin sandbox for:

Remote shell tracing

C2 artifact caching

Metadata analysis (including entropy, disassembly via Ghidra headless)




---

5. Systemd/WSL/Windows Service Layer (Cross-platform Orchestration)

systemd service for Linux/Mac deployment

Windows persistent registry + WMI beaconing (ethical use only)

Orchestrated via Docker swarm or Nomad



---

üß¨ Intelligence Model Design

Model: Nero-Kera-RAT-DetectNet

Hybrid Transformer + RNN

Input: Memory dumps, header vectorization, opcode sequence embeddings

Output:

Threat classification (benign, obfuscated, mutant, live)

Reverse shell indicator

Command intent inference



Training Sources:

PE malware corpora (public + synthetic)

Memory dumps of infected systems

Reverse PowerShell datasets (simulated)



---

üîÅ Reinforcement Engine

Policy

Penalize undetected reverse shells

Reward low false positives

Continuous learning via new forensic samples + C2 behavior



---

üß™ Example Operation Flow

1. PowerShell session initiated with suspicious obfuscation


2. Kernel hooks intercept encoded commands


3. Memory dumped and handed to Python ML engine


4. Headers analyzed ‚Üí deemed corrupted ‚Üí feed into Nero-Kera


5. Threat classified as persistent + live C2 connection ‚Üí quarantine triggered


6. GUI notifies via Switcheroo in native mode ‚Üí switches to Flutter for external audit report
