✅ Prototype Build Options (Pick What You Want First)

🔧 1. Rust Monitoring Agent Prototype

Monitors Windows firewall rule changes

Detects suspicious AppContainer policies

Sends structured events to the ML backend

Lightweight and secure using winapi, windows-rs, or sysinfo


🧠 2. Python ML Backend (Behavioral Engine)

Isolation Forest + LSTM model scaffold

Real-time anomaly scoring API (/analyze_firewall_event)

CVE + threat intel feed ingestion (MITRE/NVD API parsing)


🔐 3. Exploit Intelligence Updater

Pulls latest CVEs matching keywords (e.g., “AppContainer”, “firewall bypass”)

Classifies exploits by severity, threat actor likelihood, and system match

Updates detection models and alerts


🎛 4. Policy Orchestrator & Dashboard

Web dashboard showing logs, anomalies, process tree

Manual override: quarantine process, rollback rule, alert admin

Uses Actix-web (Rust) or FastAPI (Python) with Tailwind or ShadCN for styling


🔄 5. Patch Validation & Response Module

Verifies if system is patched for CVEs (via PowerShell + Rust or wmic)

Triggers auto-remediation scripts or security notices

📈 Data Flow Diagram & Threat Model

Would you like a visual architecture diagram (PNG/SVG) and STRIDE threat model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, etc.)?


---

🔥 Advanced Option

Would you like this deployed with:

VPN-protected backend (WireGuard)

Immutable blockchain-style log backend (e.g., using sled or a Merkle tree in Rust)

AI-tuned reinforcement rule optimizer for firewall decisions?
