Complex Intelligence PowerShell Security Monitoring System


---

1. Objectives

Real-time detection of suspicious PowerShell commands and scripts.

Behavioral anomaly detection using AI/ML on PowerShell logs.

Threat intelligence integration to detect known malicious patterns.

Contextual alerts with process/user/environment metadata.

Automated response for high-risk activities (e.g., quarantine, block).

Comprehensive forensic logging for post-incident analysis.

3. Key Components

a) PowerShell Logging Agent

Enable PowerShell Script Block Logging and Module Logging via Group Policy.

Collect logs centrally via Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) or agents (e.g., Winlogbeat).

Parse logs for:

Command invocation patterns

Encoded/obfuscated scripts

Network connections initiated by PowerShell

Process creation chains



b) Security Analytics & ML Engine

Input: Parsed PowerShell logs with metadata (user, time, process tree).

Features:

Command frequency and timing patterns

Entropy and obfuscation metrics on scripts

Process lineage and parent-child relations

User behavior baselining


Models:

Isolation Forest or Autoencoder for anomaly detection

Sequence models (LSTM) for detecting suspicious command sequences


Output: Risk score and flagged suspicious activities


c) Threat Intelligence Integration

Use feeds like:

Microsoft Defender ATP alerts

MITRE ATT&CK PowerShell techniques

Open-source PowerShell threat databases


Correlate detected anomalies with known threat patterns


d) Response Orchestrator

Automated:

Block PowerShell process or script execution via Endpoint Protection API

Quarantine offending user sessions

Notify SOC teams with enriched incident data


Manual:

Provide rich investigation dashboard with drill-down



e) Centralized Logging & Dashboard

Store logs in scalable databases (ElasticSearch, Splunk, etc.)

Visualize trends, alerts, and forensic data

Enable SOC analysts to tune detection rules and workflows

4. Data Flow

1. PowerShell logs → collected in real time → centralized store.


2. Logs parsed and feature-extracted → fed to ML engine.


3. ML engine scores and flags anomalies → cross-checked with threat intel.


4. High-risk events trigger automated or manual response.


5. Alerts and forensic info displayed on dashboard.




---

5. Additional Enhancements

Sandboxing: Run suspicious PowerShell scripts in a controlled sandbox for dynamic behavior analysis.

Reinforcement Learning: Continuously improve detection model based on SOC feedback.

Blockchain Audit: Immutable logs for tamper-proof auditing.

User Behavior Analytics (UBA): Combine PowerShell activity with other user behavior data for holistic threat detection.



---

6. Implementation Stack Suggestions

Log Collection: Windows Event Forwarding, Winlogbeat, or custom PowerShell logging agent (Rust or C#).

ML Engine: Python with TensorFlow or PyTorch; anomaly detection models.

Backend: Rust for performant real-time data processing and orchestration.

Dashboard: React or Flutter web frontend.

Threat Intel: REST APIs integration, or direct feeds.

Response Automation: Windows Defender ATP APIs, PowerShell Remoting, or custom Windows service.
