üì° Complex Intelligence Design: NR Mode Supervisor

üéØ Objective

Create an intelligent system that:

Dynamically switches 5G modes (NSA/SA) based on signal quality, battery, and threat environment.

Integrates with Qualcomm radio HAL via QcrilMsgTunnelService.

Includes ML-based prediction for optimal mode (SA for privacy or low latency; NSA for compatibility or throughput).

Provides zero-UI control via system preferences, policy controller, and adb intent fallback.

üß† System Components

1. Mode Decision Engine (Java/Kotlin + ML Inference)

Inputs:

RSRP/RSRQ/SINR from TelephonyManager

Current cell config (NSA or SA)

Battery level

App context (gaming, video call, idle)

Privacy level (e.g., geofence, sensitive location)


Model:

DecisionTree or LightGBM model trained on log data

Output: Recommended mode (NSA, SA, DUAL, DISABLE_5G)



// Example decision logic (pseudocode)
if (privacyLevel == HIGH && location in blacklist) {
    switchToSA()
} else if (rsrp < -110 || battery < 20%) {
    switchToNSA()
} else {
    maintainCurrentMode()
}


---

2. ML Data Collector Service (Android Service)

Background collector stores:

Radio state changes

Location (obfuscated if needed)

App usage at time of switch

Mode switch success/failure


Saves data in encrypted local storage, rotates logs, and uploads to training server when on Wi-Fi and idle.



---

3. Platform Integration (System App)

platform-signed + system_ext location

Provides:

BroadcastReceiver for system events

Settings integration via <intent> tag

ContentProvider for querying current mode

ShellCommandReceiver for adb shell nrswitcher --set-mode sa




---

4. Secure Policy Enforcement Layer

Optional integration with:

Device Policy Controller (DPC) for MDM

SELinux enforcement profile for preventing unprivileged apps from altering NR settings

Geo-fence & VPN awareness: if you're within a sensitive area (e.g., embassy, research base), force SA mode




---

5. UI-Less Control Surface

No launcher icon by design.

Control through:

Settings App intent (like shown in your XML snippet)

adb shell:

adb shell am start -n moe.xzr.nrmodeswitcher/.MainActivity

Internal System Preference:

<Preference
    android:key="nr_mode_switcher"
    android:persistent="false"
    android:title="5G Mode Switch"
    android:summary="Auto-switch NSA/SA based on environment">
    <intent
        android:targetPackage="moe.xzr.nrmodeswitcher"
        android:targetClass="moe.xzr.nrmodeswitcher.MainActivity" />
</Preference>

üîê Security and Intelligence Add-ons

Forensic Logging: Log each switch event with anonymized data (encrypted with device key).

Anomaly Detection: Use Isolation Forest to detect abnormal mode switch patterns (e.g., malware triggering NSA).

Remote Kill Switch: Admins can disable 5G or enforce a mode remotely via push intent if needed.

üì¶ AOSP Integration

To build and integrate:

git clone https://github.com/YourFork/NRModeSwitcher packages/apps/NRModeSwitcher
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch aosp_yourdevice-userdebug
mmm packages/apps/NRModeSwitcher

APK will be at:

out/target/product/<device>/system_ext/app/NRModeSwitcher/NRModeSwitcher.apk


---

‚úÖ Optional Extensions

Integration with GrapheneOS for hardened Android.

Reinforcement Learning: Adapt over time to environmental feedback (using PyTorch Mobile or TFLite).

Rust-powered service layer: Use JNI to call Rust logic from Java for reliability-critical components.
