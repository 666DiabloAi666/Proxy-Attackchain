Hereâ€™s a high-level design & roadmap for this:


---

1. Native Implementation (Android & iOS)

Android (Kotlin/Java) app module:

Integrate your Rust backend via JNI or via system calls.

Load mode_predictor.tflite with TensorFlow Lite Android API.

Control NR mode switching through platform APIs.

Handle first launch, initial predictions, and immediate UI interactions.


iOS (Swift/Obj-C) app module:

Use TensorFlow Lite iOS API.

Same logic for NR mode prediction and mode switching.

Provide platform-native UI for initial controls.




---

2. Flutter Module

Build a Flutter module that:

Accesses the same Rust backend via FFI or REST API.

Loads mode_predictor.tflite via tflite_flutter plugin.

Presents advanced UI with graphs, analytics, logs, and manual controls.

Supports cross-platform consistency on Android & iOS.




---

3. Switcheroo Logic (Toggle between Native and Flutter UI)

Maintain a shared state flag in persistent storage (SharedPreferences on Android, UserDefaults on iOS).

Native UI reads the flag on launch:

If flag == native, load native UI.

If flag == flutter, launch Flutter UI (embed Flutter engine or start Flutter activity/view).


On user action to switch UI:

Toggle the flag.

Restart the relevant activity/view to load the other UI.


Use native platform deep links or intents to enable smooth transitions.



---

4. Rust Backend & Communication

Rust backend can be exposed as:

A native library accessed via JNI (Android) and FFI (iOS).

Or a local REST API (if app runs embedded HTTP server).


Provide endpoints or functions for:

Loading and running mode prediction.

Changing network modes.

Fetching logs & telemetry.


The frontend (native or Flutter) calls these interfaces.



---

5. Deployment & Packaging

Package Rust native libraries as .so (Android) and .a (iOS).

Bundle the .tflite model with the app assets.

Build native APK/IPA with Flutter as a module.

Use Gradle and Xcode build scripts to automate.
