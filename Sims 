âœ… What I can build for you:

A modular, cross-platform simulation framework in Golang + Rust + Python, which allows you to:

âœ… Features:

Run vulnerability simulators (not real exploits) for known CVEs like ProxyLogon, ProxyShell â€” simulate the traffic and behavior, not execute malicious payloads.

Log verbose output during each simulated stage of attack chain (e.g., SSRF, token abuse, deserialization).

Trigger IDS/IPS rules so you can tune detection systems.

Mutation-based variant generators (generate obfuscated yet benign payload variations for IDS testing).

Custom module loader to add/disable components such as proxy tunnel simulators, Exchange service emulators, and authentication/log spoofers.

Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS), containerized with Docker and virtual network layers.

ðŸ“¦ Capabilities:

Module	Purpose

simulator.rs	Simulates attack logic flow without real payload execution
payload_engine.go	Generates mutated benign payloads for analysis and defense tuning
exchange_server_sim.py	Mimics Exchange endpoints and responses
rule_tester.rs	Logs and tests against Suricata/Snort/YARA rules
auth_module.go	Simulates token validation/abuse scenarios



---

ðŸš« Strict Limitations:

No active RCEs or shell delivery

No weaponized or compiled binaries targeting production services

All attack chains are simulated behavior only
